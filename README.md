**Path Optimizer Application with Python, NetworkX, Tkinter, and SQL Server Integration**

This repository contains a Python application for optimizing paths using NetworkX for graph-based calculations, 
Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI), and SQL Server for storing and updating location data.

**Features**

* Graph-Based Optimization: Utilizes NetworkX to represent locations as nodes and calculate the shortest paths between them.
* User-Friendly Interface: Implemented with Tkinter, providing an intuitive GUI for users to input locations, visualize paths, and optimize routes.
* SQL Server Integration: Integrates with SQL Server for storing location data, enabling seamless updating and retrieval of location information.

**Requirements**
* Python 3.x
* NetworkX
* Tkinter (included with Python)
* pyodbc (for SQL Server connectivity)
